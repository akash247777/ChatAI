# 1. How OCR and FAISS Work Together

**Tesseract OCR** is like a "text detective" for scanned PDFs. If a PDF has images of text (like a photo of a book page), Tesseract reads the pixels and converts them into editable text.

**FAISS** is a "search engine for meaning." It turns text chunks into math vectors (like coordinates in a galaxy) so the system can find similar ideas quickly, even in huge documents.

**Example:**  
Imagine a 1,000-page medical textbook. Tesseract extracts text from scanned diagrams, FAISS maps all the words into a "medical knowledge galaxy," and when you ask, "How does insulin work?" the system finds the closest matching chunks in seconds.

# 2. Optimizing Indexing for Large Documents

**Problem:**  
Big PDFs (1,000+ pages) can overwhelm the system.

**Solutions:**

### A. Chunking: Cutting the Text into Bite-Sized Pieces

- **Why?**  
  A 1,000-page book can’t be processed as one giant block.

- **How?**  
  We split the text into smaller chunks (like paragraphs or sections) using a tool called `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
  
  - **Chunk size:** ~1,000 characters (not pages) to balance context and speed.
  - **Overlap:** Each chunk overlaps with the previous one by ~200 characters. This avoids losing context at chunk boundaries (e.g., a sentence split mid-thought).

### B. Page Number Tracking

- **What?**  
  Every chunk remembers its original page number.

- **Why?**  
  When the AI answers, it cites the exact page (e.g., "Insulin is described on Page 245").

### C. FAISS Indexing Tricks

- **Batch Processing:**  
  Instead of loading all 1,000 pages into memory at once, we process chunks in batches (like loading a truck one box at a time).

- **Index Compression:**  
  FAISS uses algorithms like IVF (Inverted File Index) to group similar vectors together. Think of it as organizing books by genre in a library—finding "medical" topics becomes faster because you only search the "medicine" section.

# 3. Balancing Precision vs. Recall

**Definitions:**

- **Precision:**  
  The percentage of answers that are relevant.

- **Recall:**  
  The percentage of all relevant answers found.

**Challenges:**

- **Too much precision:**  
  The system might miss valid answers (e.g., ignoring a paragraph about "blood sugar" when you asked about "diabetes").

- **Too much recall:**  
  The system floods you with irrelevant results (e.g., listing every mention of "sugar" in a cookbook when you asked about diabetes).

**Solutions:**

### A. Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic)

- **Keyword Search:**  
  Finds exact matches (e.g., "diabetes" in a document).

- **Semantic Search:**  
  Finds similar ideas (e.g., "blood sugar," "insulin resistance").

- **Combined:**  
  The system blends both results, like using a map (keywords) and a compass (semantics) to navigate.

### B. Adjustable "Strictness"

- **Technical Docs (e.g., legal contracts):**  
  We set a high similarity threshold. Only chunks very close to the query in the "meaning galaxy" are returned.

- **Casual Docs (e.g., blogs):**  
  We set a lower threshold to allow more creative answers.

### C. Overlapping Chunks

By overlapping chunks, the system avoids missing context. For example, if a question spans two chunks, the overlap ensures both are considered.

# 4. Making Embeddings Understand Nuances

**Problem:**  
Words like "python" (snake vs. programming language) can confuse the AI.

**Solutions:**

### A. Sentence Transformers

- **What?**  
  We use a model called `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, which is trained to turn sentences into vectors that capture their meaning.

- **Example:**  
  "Python is a snake" and "Python is a programming language" get different vectors because their meanings differ.

### B. Cleaning OCR Text

- **Challenge:**  
  Scanned PDFs often have typos (e.g., "insulin" → "insul1n" due to poor image quality).

- **Solution:**  
  We clean the text before creating embeddings.

### C. Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning

- **What?**  
  For specialized fields (e.g., medicine), we train the model on domain-specific texts. This teaches it that "python" in a biology paper refers to a snake, not code.

### D. Metadata Boosting

- **What?**  
  Section headers (e.g., "Chapter 5: Diabetes") are given higher importance in embeddings.

- **Why?**  
  This helps the system prioritize chunks under relevant headings.

# 5. Challenges We’re Still Solving

- **Ambiguous Queries:**  
  Questions like "Tell me about Java" could refer to the programming language or the island. We’re adding a follow-up prompt (e.g., "Did you mean Java the language or Java the place?").

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  Non-English documents sometimes have lower accuracy. We’re testing models like `bert-base-multilingual` for better results.

- **Speed:**  
  While FAISS is fast, processing 10,000+ pages can still take time. We’re exploring GPU acceleration for faster indexing.

# 6. Future Plans

- **Multimodal Embeddings:**  
  Teach the system to analyze charts, tables, and images in PDFs (not just text).

- **Active Learning:**  
  If users mark an answer as "wrong," the system retrains itself to avoid similar mistakes.

- **Chat History Context:**  
  Let the AI remember previous questions to handle follow-ups like "Tell me more about that study you mentioned."

# Why This Matters

Imagine a researcher analyzing 1,000-page clinical trial reports. Instead of skimming for hours, they ask:
- "Show me all side effects of Drug X."
- "Compare success rates between Trial A and Trial B."

The system finds answers in seconds, cites pages, and explains results in simple terms. That’s the power of combining OCR, FAISS, and AI!
